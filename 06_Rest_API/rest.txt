What is RESTful API?
RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. Most business applications have to communicate with other internal and third-party applications to perform various tasks. For example, to generate monthly payslips, your internal accounts system has to share data with your customer's banking system to automate invoicing and communicate with an internal timesheet application. RESTful APIs support this information exchange because they follow secure, reliable, and efficient software communication standards.

Server will do it's job => will provide data in raw format(like JSON) => frontend can decide what to do with that data
If we know for sure that our client is a browser...in that case we should send HTML or else (like alexa or something or cross-platform service) we can send JSON(key:value)
Always respect all HTTP methods
